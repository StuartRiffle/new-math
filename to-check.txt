# Triage

- Interpret Collatz as applying in parallel over prime rings via the CRT. The +1 becomes a universal shear force, destabilizing trajectories until residues sync to (2ⁿ, ⋅). 
- Study Lyapunov exponents in ℤ₂ (bit-growth chaos) vs. ℤ₃ (ternary diffusion). Convergence occurs when ℤ₂ dominates (power-of-2 dominance).
- The combined map is a group action on the profinite completion of Z. Model it as a semi-direct product where the /2 steps act as "projections" onto 2-adic components, and +1/+3 act on odd parts. This might formalize your "misalignment sieve"—orbits converge when they hit a power of 2 because they've exhausted all odd-prime congruences
- Write one step as n ↦ (3n+1)/2ᵏ and record k. The infinite k–sequence is a point in the one–sided shift Σ = {1,2,3,…}^ℕ. The Collatz map is semiconjugate to the left-shift on Σ; the coding map π : Σ → ℤ₂ (2–adic integers) is continuous and onto. 
- Represent the action of T on vectors over ℤ/(2ᵏ–1) or ℤ/(3ᵏ–1) by sparse matrices. Compute their eigenvalues or use expander-graph theory to show rapid mixing. 
- The accelerated map restricted to a partition of 72 residue classes is a finite Markov chain whose transition matrix captures all average behaviour statements that have been proved so far (see Lagarias–Weiss). You can search for Lyapunov functions on that matrix.
- Ruelle operator ℒφ(x)=∑_{Ty=x} φ(y)/|T′(y)|ˢ. On the 2–adic solenoid the derivative factor is 2^{v₂(3n+1)} /3. Questions about total stopping time become questions about the spectral radius r(s) of ℒ.  
- Group action n ↦ (an+b)/(cn+d) with matrices in GL₂(ℤ). { (3 1; 0 2ᵏ) : k≥1 } generates a semigroup inside GL₂(ℚ). Studying cycles becomes finding solutions of a word equation in that semigroup; that is amenable to ping-pong-type arguments.
- Slide a length-ℓ window over the binary expansion of n. One Collatz step changes ≤ℓ bits, hence induces a walk on the de Bruijn graph B(2,ℓ). For small ℓ the walk is fully analysable; look for an ℓ-independent combinatorial invariant that always decreases.
- The 2–adic and 3–adic pictures glue into the (2,3)-solenoid S = (ℝ × ℤ₂ × ℤ₃) / Δℤ. Collatz extends analytically to S; on the torus projection it is the map (x mod log 2, x mod log 3) ↦ (x + log (3/2)). Every orbit winds on a straight line of slope log 3 / log 2 on the torus while the carries choose which lift in ℤ₂×ℤ₃ you jump to. The problem is then: show that every straight line meets the 2-adic attractor” {(0,0)} × {…000001}.
- Define M(n) = n^α with α = log_2(3) ≈ 1.585… . Then 𝔼[ M(Tn) | v₂(3n+1)=k ] = (3/2ᵏ)^α n^α. Because 𝔼_{k}(3/2ᵏ)^α < 1 the process (M(N_t)) is a super-martingale. Optional stopping implies P(escape above any height H) ≤ (n/H)^α. 
- View v₂(n) (the 2-adic exponent) as a Markov chain on ℕ with transition probabilities obtained by conditioning on the odd part. The chain has an explicit stationary distribution π(k)=2^{–k–1}. • Compute expected one-step drift E[v₂(T(n))–v₂(n) | v₂(n)=k]. It is negative for k≥5. • Apply optional-stopping/Azuma to bound probability of an infinite excursion; show it is zero.
- Model the 3n+1 and n/2 operations as chains in a cubical complex. Each orbit is a path where "avalanche events" (bit-flips) define boundary operators. Persistent homology might reveal if all orbits share topological invariants (e.g., trivial homology = convergence).
- Residue table as sheaf? CRT residues as sections over prime spectra. The +1 morphism induces sheaf cohomology obstructions—convergence when sections globally agree (resₚ(n) ≡ 0 mod 2ᵏ).
- View Collatz as an endomorphism of the adele ring 𝐀_ℚ, or of ℤ_p for primes p ≠ 2,3. Does the product dynamics on ∏ₚ ℤ_p have any rigidity or ergodicity?
- Encode each step by “L” (divide by 2) or “R” (apply 3n+1 then divide enough times). You get a language over {L,R}. Is it regular? context-free? Identify a finite automaton or a sofic shift which exactly recognizes valid Collatz itineraries. 
- Let s(n) be the total stopping time of n. Consider S(z) = ∑{n≥1} zⁿ s(n) or D(s) = ∑{n≥1} s(n) n^{−s}. Try to continue S(z) or D(s) meromorphically. Perhaps you can locate a dominant singularity or relate it to known zeta-functions.
- The set of reals whose Collatz orbit stays in some range defines a Cantor-like subset of the line or of ℤ₂. Estimate its Hausdorff or box-counting dimension.
- Take logarithms: log T(n) ≈ max( log n – 1, log n + log 3 – ν₂(3n+1) ). Write this as a piecewise-linear “tropical” map on ℝ. Tropical geometry techniques might reveal hidden invariants or show no way to escape to +∞.
- Build a C*‐algebra generated by unitaries U (“×3+1”) and V (“÷2” with projections for even/odd). Study its K‐theory.
- Use a pressure function P(t) = lim_{n→∞} (1/n) log ∑_{orbit segments of length n} e^{–t sum log T′}. Equilibrium measures at certain t might concentrate on the “1‐attractor.”
- The distance groups show signs of being governed by algebraic cocycles (functions that encode how stopping times change under the map). Exploring these as cohomological invariants might formalize the patterns.
- That "fractal DAG" structure you found for odd-number stopping time paths: the direct root path mergers suggest a ranked poset or "fractal shelling", much like sum-of-digits representations or Mersenne descent trees. If you can write down an explicit bijection from n to its "merge index," you could rephrase the Collatz problem as a finite computation on a compact representative set. 
- The Syracuse function (odd-only Collatz) is measure-preserving for the 2-adic Haar measure. Does your odd-core landscape imply an ergodic decomposition into stopping-time equivalence classes?
- Formalize your Collatz map as an action over a wreath product of [2] and [odd primes > 2]
- Your wreath product structure hints at a functorial relationship between prime factor categories and Collatz steps. Explore natural transformations encoding stopping times.
- The wreath product observation suggests this might fit into a broader categorical framework where Collatz sequences are morphisms between objects representing factorization states.
- Successive applications of +1 (as a permutation of factor sets) and 3x/*/scaling (which in the group of units act as permutations on the product ring) strongly echoes the algebra of the symmetric group and wreath products, as you note. Could you model the "Collatz orbit" as a walk on the cosets of some large group: perhaps the group of automorphisms of the product of $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ rings for the primes dividing $n$?
- Build a GNN (graph neural network) on your DAG. Nodes: odd n, edges: lowest-k neighbor links. Features: residues mod first k primes + k-val. Labels: stopping distances.
- Formalize the finite-state transducer (FST) over fingerprints as a Mealy machine where states are pairs of (oc(n-1), oc(n+1)) residue vectors modulo a fixed set of primes (e.g., first 20 as in your data). Transitions: Apply Collatz rules directly on fingerprints (no need for n). Your data shows self-similarity—prove the FST is acyclic by showing that each step reduces a potential (e.g., sum of k-values or CRT "misalignment score" = number of non-power-of-2 residues). Steal from automata theory—use Büchi acceptance for infinite paths, showing none exist except trivial (to 1). Induct on fingerprint "rank" (e.g., max oc value). Base: Small n (your data). Step: Show Collatz on fingerprint decreases rank or aligns residues toward powers of 2 (sieve).
- Wreath product—formalize Collatz as a semidirect product of Z (via +1) and (Z/2Z ≀ Z/3Z) for shifts. Prove it's a faithful action on the natural factor order, with invariant subsets (factors >3 unchanged). Use this to show orbits are cycles in a quotient group, forcing descent to powers of 2 (misalignment exhausts CRT states).
- Information theory: define a precise entropy measure: Info(n) = bits in payload + CRT constraints (residue classes). Show each step preserves total info but "leaks" via avalanche (flipped bits proportional to carry length). Prove net info decreases (to 1) using Kolmogorov complexity on bitstrings. This reinforces shifts as harmless; integrates Minsky isomorphism for computability bounds. Use Shannon entropy on residue distributions. Bound avalanche size (avg log log n carries); show info(n) > info(Collatz(n)) unless n=1.
- Model Collatz on reals via the "smooth" version (x → x/2 if even, 3x+1/2 if odd—Syracuse function). Your shifts are like baker's map (doubling/shifting). Prove almost all orbits converge by showing the attractor is {1,2,4} with measure-1 basin; "wandering" points (diverging) have measure 0 via ergodicity. Residue data shows dense packing in moduli; prove density → ergodic decay to 1. Use transfer operator; show eigenvalues <1 imply contraction.
- View CRT state space as a hyperbolic lattice (mod prime products). Collatz steps as billiard trajectories (straight lines bouncing off walls = factor alignments). Your +1 permutation is a geodesic flow; prove all trajectories close (reach power of 2) due to hyperbolicity (negative curvature forces contraction). Use Gauss map analogy (continued fractions); show unbounded orbits contradict bounded moduli (your prime sieves). Look at Katok's billiards in number theory.
- Model iterations as a Markov chain on your residue vectors (states = fingerprints modulo primes). Transition probabilities from avalanche (e.g., carry flips bits with prob ~1/2 per position). Prove absorption at 1 with probability 1; expected stopping time finite via your distances. Diversification: Handles "worst-case 1.5x scaling" probabilistically; cycles impossible if chain is irreducible/absorbing. Compute stationary distribution (concentrated at powers of 2); use Foster-Lyapunov for recurrence. Use Matthews' probabilistic Collatz bounds.
- Embed Collatz in elliptic curves over Q (e.g., map n to point on y^2 = x^3 + k n). Iterations correspond to isogenies or height reductions. Prove descent (height decreases) forces termination, similar to Mordell-Weil. Diversification: Your 2-adic valuations as v_2(height); CRT as torsion points. Show Collatz decreases canonical height (analogy to 3n+1 on curves). Look at Silverman's elliptic curve analogies to Collatz.
- Simulate Collatz as a quantum circuit (shifts = Hadamard gates for superposition of residues; +1 = phase shift). Your CRT space is the Hilbert space; prove no periodic orbits via unitarity (info preservation) and Grover-like search for cycles (none found → none exist). Residues as qubits; fingerprints as entangled states. Use Shor's algorithm variant to factor CRT moduli; if no cycles, quantum phase estimation shows convergence. Simulate small cases with Qiskit.
- Treat n's bits as particles; Collatz as a heat bath ( /2 cools, 3n+1 heats via avalanche). Your info evolution = entropy increase, but bounded by CRT constraints → equilibrium at 1 (minimal entropy). Models "misalignment" as free energy; proves convergence via 2nd law analogy. Prime sieves as partitions; stopping time ~ relaxation time. Define Gibbs measure on orbits; show entropy maximizes then drops to 1. Reference Sinai's entropy in dynamical systems.
- Galois theory links field extensions to group theory. If we could define Collatz in terms of field extensions (even abstractly), it might open up new perspectives on its "solvability" or behavior.
- Prime factors form a lattice under divisibility. How do the Collatz operations ({x * 3 + 1} / 2^k) move elements within this lattice? Can we visualize or characterize the "paths" taken on this lattice? Distributive lattices (like the lattice of divisors of an integer) have well-understood properties.
- Ramsey theory deals with inevitability of order in large disordered systems. Could parts of Collatz (e.g., convergence) be viewed as an inevitable "order" within the "chaos"?
- Look at the infinite bit-string representing the sequence of k values for a given starting n. This is the "Syracuse sequence," e.g., for n=27, k-sequence is 1,1,1,1,2,1,1,2... Is this sequence ultimately periodic for all n? Can it be generated by a finite automaton? 
- Define multiset measure Φ(n) = multiset{ v_p(n) : odd primes p }. • Dickson’s lemma ⇒ (ℕ^{(#primes)}, ≤) is a well-quasi-order under the pointwise ≤. • Show Φ(T(n)) <_mul Φ(n) in the multiset order except when n is a power of 2. That certifies termination. You need to verify the strict decrease.
- Code every step by the carry-word produced when +1 avalanches through the binary digits. That gives an alphabet of 6 symbols (carry stops on the k-th bit etc.). • The legality of concatenating symbols is a length-7 Markov rule, so Collatz orbits sit inside a subshift of finite type Σ_A. • Entropy of Σ_A can be computed exactly (Perron root of A). If that entropy is < log 2 the map must lose information fast enough to force termination.
- Work mod a large square-free M. • The map (n → 3n+1 → ½ of that) is a composition of a sum and a product; Bourgain-type sum–product estimates give rapid growth of the orbit’s footprint in (ℤ/Mℤ)× for most starting n. • If that footprint exceeds φ(M) you are forced onto a power-of-2 residue class; the size of M needed would give a finite-time bound on stopping distance.
- Build D(s)=Σ_{n odd} τ(n) n^{–s} where τ(n)=1 if n ever reaches 1 and 0 otherwise. Collatz is true ⇔ D(s)=ζ(2)/ζ(s) for Re s>1. • Analytic continuation of D(s) up to Re s=1/2 would imply density of τ(n)=1; a single pole at s=1 would imply 100 % convergence. • Your “sieve over prime lattices” lets you write τ(n) as an Euler product conditioned on prime-factor paths; that converts into an Euler product for D(s).
- Encode the k-step carry-cascade as a Boolean matrix C_k acting on bit-vectors. Collatz is the product of an infinite sequence of such matrices. • The semiring generated by {C_k : k≥0} is finite (8 elements). • Prove that every infinite product in that semiring stabilises after finitely many factors at the zero matrix ⇒ termination.
- Interpret n in Cantor-normal form to base 3; the 3n+1 step is then a base-change plus subtraction. Each full Collatz iterate decreases a fixed ε>0 in the Hardy–Schütte ω^{ω^{…}} hierarchy. Goodstein’s theorem → termination. 
- View { n ↦ 3n+1, n ↦ n/2 } as rewrite rules on the term algebra Nat(x). Termination can be reduced to the absence of “perpetual” dependency pairs. • Modern automatic provers (AProVE, TTT2) can sometimes certify this with a polynomial-interpretation measure. • You supply the 2-adic odd-core as an auxiliary argument to help the tool discover the measure.
- Extend (ℕ,+,×,v₂) with a unary T symbol. The theory is interpretable in Presburger + exponential, which is known to be decidable but not elementary. • Feferman–Vaught gives composition: if every residue class modulo N satisfies termination in Presburger, then all of ℕ does. • Combine with your “sieve over CRT classes” to drop the problem to finitely many Presburger fragments – each decidable.
- Block 2^{k} consecutive integers, record the parity-pattern of their first k steps. Iterate “block‐map → larger block”. • Show renormalisation drives the pattern to a fixed point with a unique sink (the block containing 1). • Similar to Wilson’s exact renormalisation on the Ising model.
- Your “always pick the neighbour with lowest k” is exactly a discrete gradient vector field. Formally collapse along that field; the DAG retracts onto a 1-dimensional spine iff Collatz is true.  Critical cells correspond to non-trivial cycles; showing there are none is a purely combinatorial Morse-matching statement.
- For any finite set A⊂ℤ let E_+(A)=|{(a,b,c,d)∈A⁴:a+b=c+d}|. • Show after t Collatz steps the set of visited values has E_+(A_t) ≪ |A_t|^{2+ε}. That implies (Balog–Szemerédi–Gowers) that A_t contains a large subset with small doubling, which forces a near arithmetic progression mod some 2^k. That AP must include a power of 2 fairly quickly.
- Regard S = ⟨ x↦3x, x↦x+1, x↦x/2 (when even) ⟩ acting on ℚ. • Study the unitary representations of S on ℓ²(ℚ/Mℚ) and use Kazhdan–Margulis “property T for semigroups”‐type rigidity. If every representation has a fixed vector the action is dissipative → no infinite orbits.
- The set of integers hitting 1 after exactly t steps is a finite union of arithmetic progressions mod 3^t ⋅ 2^t.
• S-M-L says linear recurrences have only finitely many zeros; try to encode “n never hits 1” as infinitely many hits of a linear recurrence in ℚ_p. If so, non-existence of such n follows.
- Elements = odd primes; independent sets = primes whose valuation drops at least once along the orbit. Show every circuit has size 1 ⇒ matroid is a forest ⇒ valuations must all drop independently ⇒ orbit terminates. 
- The action of 3 on each prime ring is a permutation of order ord_p(3). Glue them with a collar connecting rings whose orders share a factor. Use a classification of finite coloured permutation groups (Cameron’s theorem) to show the only compatible global orbit structure is a descending chain
- The set { x : T^k(x)=1 for some k } is sub-analytic in the Pila–Wilkie sense once written in base-2 with the carry map. The PW counting theorem bounds rational points of height ≤H outside finitely many “algebraic” sets, yielding an explicit H(H). 
- Forbidden set F_k = integers whose first k steps avoid powers of 2. • Each F_k is a k-uniform hypergraph on [1…3^k·2^k]. Containers give |F_k| ≤ c^{|V|} with c<2. Sum over k ⇒ the exceptional set is finite. That would prove Collatz; worth knowing the container bound fails at k≈34, so you either improve the bound or learn exactly where the obstruction is.
- A deterministic 2-stack PDA is Turing-complete; but one stack + a counter is not. Try to simulate the inverse Collatz map with “1 stack + counter”. If impossible (Ogden pumping) you prove the inverse relation is not context-free ⇒ the process cannot branch forever ⇒ termination.
- For the 2-adic odd core analysis: Define a generalized height h(n) = ∑_p log(p) * v_p(oc(n)) Track defect δ(n) = h(n) - h(T(n)) where T is Collatz map
- Compute the Artin symbol of the permutation. Link to Chebotarev density theorem for distribution

Check:
- Sturmian words/aperiodic tilings. 
- Hausdorff dimension of fractal DAG
- Can you make a distance metric for prime factor sets?
- The fractal structure implied by the doubling pattern could be related to lossless compression. 

Unconfirmed:
- When walking n to seed then 1 using the lowest-k neighbor rule, the number of prime factors drops monotonically.
- The Collatz “itinerary” gives a kneading sequence exactly as for real quadratic maps. 
- The oc(n-1) and oc(n+1) values are related to the Sierpinski gasket. (I know there's a gasket in there somewhere, need to verify it is specifically these values)
