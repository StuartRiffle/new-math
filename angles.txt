# Proof Strategies

The research allows independent arguments in multiple domains of math. They are sketched here at various stages of development.

## Prime Factor Set Cursor
- Establish Collatz as permutation of natural order
- Define the action of the semidirect product ⟨2⟩ ⋉ ⟨3⟩ on the free abelian group of odd primes. 
- Compute orbit lengths of factor-sets mod small square-free products; look for a local-to-global principle (“if the cursor empties mod M then it empties globally”)

## Finite State Transducer over Odd Cores
- Use a Mealy machine
- Prove acyclic using Buchi acceptance or rank induction

## Functorial Action over Wreath Products
- Model the transform as a wreath product.
- Formalize Collatz as a semidirect product of Z (via +1) and (Z/2Z ≀ Z/3Z) for shifts. 
- Prove it's a faithful action on the natural factor order, with invariant subsets (factors >3 unchanged).
- Use this to show orbits are cycles in a quotient group, forcing descent to powers of 2 (misalignment exhausts CRT states)
- Prove the action exhausts CRT states (forcing power-of-2) via coset walks could sieve all orbits to 1 (is this a different argument or isomorphic?)

## Semigroup Action
- You're observing natural structure formed by {3n+1, /2, iteration} and their matrix representation.
- Working in a semigroup is more flexible than full group constraints. 
- Action of semigroup on residue lattices preserves so much structure that it may expose an invariant signature that triggers stopping. 
- Use ping-pong argument + matrix word trace to exclude periodicity for large n.

## 2-adic Graph Traversal
- Model seed walk and root traversal
- Directly calculate stopping time

## Information Theory
- Measure info as bit-flips + residue constraints; show each step leaks info (Kolmogorov complexity drops) until 1. 
- Show each step preserves total info but "leaks" via avalanche
- Prove net info decreases (to 1) using Kolmogorov complexity on bitstrings
- Gives a physical-style Lyapunov function: the average carry chain is logarithmic, the average left-shift is linear – a net information bleed is plausible.
- Model carries as a branching process, compute expected avalanche length, compare to the expected (3n+1)/2^k shrink factor.
- A formal bound of “expected log₂(n) drops by ε per step” would kill all divergent trajectories in expectation.

## Lattice Sieve
- Rigorously define Φ(n) as the multiset of all v_p(n) for all odd primes, or possibly a bounded set. 
- Show that Φ(T(n)) <_mul Φ(n) in the multiset order (Dickson's Lemma). 

## Billiard Trajectories in a Hyperbolic CRT Lattice
- +1 as geodesic flow
- Prove closure via negative curvature forcing contraction to power-of-two attractor.
- View CRT state space as a hyperbolic lattice (mod prime products). Collatz steps as billiard trajectories... 
- Your +1 permutation is a geodesic flow; prove all trajectories close (reach power of 2) due to hyperbolicity (negative curvature forces contraction).

## Quantum Circuit Simulation
- Simulate Collatz as a quantum circuit (shifts = Hadamard gates for superposition of residues; +1 = phase shift). 
- Your CRT space is the Hilbert space; prove no periodic orbits via unitarity (info preservation) and Grover-like search for cycles (none found → none exist). 
- Residues as qubits; fingerprints as entangled states.
- Use Shor's algorithm variant to factor CRT moduli; if no cycles, quantum phase estimation shows convergence. Simulate small cases with Qiskit.

## Tropical Geometry on Log-Scale Mapping
- Take logarithms: log T(n) ≈ max( log n – 1, log n + log 3 – ν₂(3n+1) ).
- Write this as a piecewise-linear 'tropical' map on ℝ.
- Prove no escape via piecewise-linear contraction

## Equilibrium Measures on Orbits
- Prove concentration at 1 via spectral radius.

## Discrete Morse Theory
- Lowest-k rule is a vector field
- Formally collapse along that field; the DAG retracts onto a 1-dimensional spine iff Collatz is true.
- Critical cells correspond to non-trivial cycles; showing there are none is a purely combinatorial Morse-matching statement.
- Prove no critical cells exist

## Multiset Measure with Well-Quasi-ordering
- Define Φ(n) = multiset{v_p(n) : odd primes p}
- Use Dickson's lemma: (ℕ^(#primes), ≤) is a well-quasi-order under pointwise ≤
- Show Φ(T(n)) <_mul Φ(n) in the multiset order except when n is a power of 2
- This certifies termination via a decrease in the prime valuation structure

## Symbolic Shift
- ?

## Symbolic Collapse
- ?

## Markov Chain on Residue Vectors
- For each M = 2^κ·product(odd primes up to p_max) the induced state chain on CRT classes is irreducible on its graph; then the unique absorbing state is the class 1 inverse image.
- Use the known fair coin phase-transition (Tao/Jeffrey) to show positive probability flow into the class {1}.

## Integer Equivalence Class Partition
- ?
