The "core residue environment" is a matrix with 5 columns representing the prime residue vector of a number n, its odd neighbors, and the odd cores of its even neighbors (their 2-adic bases).

This is the "local" residue environment of n, and the properties of neighboring numbers are correlated. Information about n can be extracted from this environment matrix.

Do a deep dive and uncover as many of these correlations as you can. We're trying to find new information, something novel hiding in there.
