# Stopping distance groups

Each odd number in the stopping group listing is given with a pair of 2-adic "odd core" valuations for its immediate even neighbors.

This pair of vectors {oc(n-1), oc(n+1)} is like a "fingerprint" of a number's local arithmetic environment.
It is *self-similar* and correlated with arithmetic properties in general, and Collatz evolution specifically.
Within some distance groups, there are doublings with apparently recursive structure.
It seems like they are part of the same graph but spilled across a wide range of numbers.
There is strong order here, in fact most of it looks boilerplate.

For example, look at distance group 42.
We start with n=73, the lowest in magnitude, and valuations of neighbors 72 and 74, respectively:

`n`   - an odd integer
`ocl` - odd core of n's even neighbor to the left (n-1)
`ocr` - odd core of n's even neighbor to the right (n+1)

n, ocl,  cr
73,(9 3),(37 1)

(75 follows 73 and is referenced later in the structure, but is not part of this distance group, it has distance 3).

The "seed" number 73 has a doubled presence at 145 and 147. They share neighbor 146 in the middle.
Their core values all match or point to the seed number 73. This part looks deterministic.

145,  (9 4), (73 1)     # shared middle neighbor 146 links both to 73
147, (73 1), (37 2)     # "uplink" to 37 (?)

(149 follows 147 and is referenced later in the structure, but is not part of this distance group, it has distance 6).

There is now a re-doubling, which links back to the first doubled presence around 146. The shared middle neighbor 292 again links to 73.

291, (145 1),  (73 2)   # link back to first doubled (145)
293,  (73 2), (147 1)   # link back to secobd doubled (147)

(295 follows 293 and is referenced later in the structure, but is not part of this distance group, it has distance 18).

Just past the redoubling we have this "connector".
It's not clear why this appears at 299, except that it's similar to a re-doubling of 75, which is adjacent to the original seed 73 (?)

299, (149 1), (75, 2) # 149 is after the doubled presence, 75 follows the original 73

But now we double a *third* time, sort of. The structure has grown more complex, but still ordered.

581, (145 2), (291 1)   # link back to first doubled (145) and first redoubled (291)
                        # skipping 2 odd numbers, 584 in center, which has odd core 73
587, (293 1), (147 2)   # link back to second redoubled (293) and second doubled (147)
589, (147 2), (295 1)   # shared middle neighbor 588 links back to 147, and 295, just _after_ the second redoubled
                        # skipping 2 odd numbers, 594 in center, which has odd core 297
599, (299 1), (75 3)    # link back to the previous connector, after the re-doubling, and (like it) back to 75

It continues like this. The distance groups seem to be something like a handful of seed values in an infinite hall of mirrors.

It appears that following the even neighbor with the lowest k value can allow n to move through the tree of doublings to its distance group seed.
