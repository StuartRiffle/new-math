- The symmetry of totient gaps in radical cycles is what enabled an infinitude of primes.
- For any finite radical cycle the symmetry of the gap structure ensures Ï†(N) coprime positions remain, and as N grows to include more primes, the recursive symmetry guarantees that new coprime positions (potential primes) always exist. Thus, there are infinitely many primes.
