# Lemmas

These are the main provable claims. 

## General

Lemma (Countercycling gap alignment):
- Let N = p₁p₂…pₖ. Let f(x) = 1 if gcd(x,N)=1, 0 otherwise. Then for all k: f(N+k)=f(N-k), i.e., symmetric at each offset from N. 
- This holds regardless of the parity of N or the inclusion of 2. 
- For general x, f(x) = f(2N-x), so the gap pattern is periodic mod N.
