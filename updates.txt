Seed values are the odd predecessors of numbers with stopping distance d-1. Their orbits will converge in one step.

A number n is arithmetically linked to the odd cores of its neighbors. Specifically, if n = 2m ± 1 (i.e., it has a neighbor with k=1), its Collatz successor C(n) is directly related to 3m ± const.

The residue vectors encode oc's congruence class modulo small primes, which directly


Multi-seed stopping groups correspond to distinct CRT-cosets in the CRT automaton tree, but within these cosets, propagation is again deterministic and regular.

The mapping from CRT-residue vector to stopping distance is ultimately finite and periodic modulo some product of small primes, with exceptions (branch-points) depending on higher-order modulus behavior but fully captured by the (n−1,n+1) fingerprint.
