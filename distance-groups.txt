# Stopping distance groups

Attached is a list of the first odd numbers, grouped by Collatz odd-to-odd stopping distance.

Each odd number is represented by 2 consecutive lines giving partial residue vectors for the 2-adic odd cores of its even neighbors.
For example, the odd number 73 is represented like below, as the odd core residues and 2-adic valuations of 72 and 74 respectively:

desc,k,oc,m3,m5,m7,m11,m13,m17,m19,m23,m29,m31
oc(73-1),3,9,0,4,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9
oc(73+1),1,37,1,2,2,4,11,3,18,14,8,6

This pair of vectors (oc(n-1), oc(n+1)) is like a "fingerprint" of a number's local arithmetic environment.
It is *self-similar* and correlated with arithmetic properties in general, and Collatz evolution specifically.
Within some distance groups, there are doublings with apparently recursive structure.
It seems like they are part of the same graph but spilled across a wide range of numbers.
There is strong order here, in fact most of it looks "boilerplate".

For example, look at distance group 42. We start with n=73, the lowest in magnitude, which has a couple of external references I don't know:

oc(73-1),3,9,0,4,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9        # Core of 9 (?), which has distance 6
oc(73+1),1,37,1,2,2,4,11,3,18,14,8,6    # "uplink" to "parent frame" 37 (?), which has distance 6

(75 follows 73 and is referenced later in the structure, but is not part of this distance group, it has distance 3).

The "seed" number 73 has a doubled presence at 145 and 147. They share neighbor 146 in the middle.
Their core values all match or point to the seed number 73. This part looks deterministic.

oc(145-1),4,9,0,4,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9		# Core of 9 (?)
oc(145+1),1,73,1,3,3,7,8,5,16,4,15,11	# Linking back to 73
oc(147-1),1,73,1,3,3,7,8,5,16,4,15,11	# (duplicate: same shared neighbor 146)
oc(147+1),2,37,1,2,2,4,11,3,18,14,8,6	# "uplink" to "parent frame" 37 (?)

(149 follows 147 and is referenced later in the structure, but is not part of this distance group, it has distance 6).

There is now a re-doubling, which links back to the first doubled presence around 146.

oc(291-1),1,145,1,0,5,2,2,9,12,7,0,21	# Link back to first doubled
oc(291+1),2,73,1,3,3,7,8,5,16,4,15,11	# Still linked to 73
oc(293-1),2,73,1,3,3,7,8,5,16,4,15,11	# (duplicate: same shared neighbor 292)
oc(293+1),1,147,0,2,0,4,4,11,14,9,2,23	# Link back to second doubled

(295 follows 293 and is referenced later in the structure, but is not part of this distance group, it has distance 18).

Just past the redoubling we have this "connector". It's not clear why this appears at 299, except that it's similar to a re-doubling of 75, which is adjacent to the original seed 73 (?)

oc(299-1),1,149,2,4,2,6,6,13,16,11,4,25 # 149 is after the doubled presence
oc(299+1),2,75,0,0,5,9,10,7,18,6,17,13	# 75 is next after original 73

But now we double a *third* time, sort of. The structure has grown more complex, but still highly ordered.

oc(581-1),2,145,1,0,5,2,2,9,12,7,0,21	# Link back to first doubled
oc(581+1),1,291,0,1,4,5,5,2,6,15,1,12	# Link back to first redoubled
# skipping 2 odd numbers
oc(587-1),1,293,2,3,6,7,7,4,8,17,3,14	# Link back to second redoubled
oc(587+1),2,147,0,2,0,4,4,11,14,9,2,23	# Link back to second doubled
oc(589-1),2,147,0,2,0,4,4,11,14,9,2,23	# (duplicate: same shared neighbor 588)
oc(589+1),1,295,1,0,1,9,9,6,10,19,5,16	# 295 appears after the redoubled presence
# skipping 4 odd numbers
oc(599-1),1,299,2,4,5,2,0,10,14,0,9,20	# Link back to the previous connector, after the re-doubling
oc(599+1),3,75,0,0,5,9,10,7,18,6,17,13	# Also locked in at 75, like previous connector

It appears to continue like this. The distance groups seem something like a handful of seed values in an infinite hall of mirrors. Just spot checking, it appears that simply following the even neighbor with the lowest k value (??) can allow n to move through the tree of doublings to its distance group seed. That would make determining stopping distance a matter of solving just the seed values, a much [astronomically] smaller problem, and there is a nonzero chance we can do that.

Pay particular attention to distance groups with multiple seed values listed. The doublings may be illusions, but there is something linking all the seeds to the same stopping distance, a property all those seed numbers share, making them Collatz-equivalent in this way. Look at their neighborhoods, why did those seed values end up together in this distance group?

There is analytical opportunity here: if the different seeds in the distance groups proceed along their orbits and diverge, it means there are multiple "paths" to the root of the structure, and the differences between them could expose the actual invariants/relationships we're looking for. 

There are known branching points in the inverse Collatz tree. Being special, they may expose clues. 
The external references (9, 37, 75, 149, 295) have stopping distances all small multiples of 3.
They seem to be correlated at least with each other (?), whether or not they reflect anything about distance group 42 itself.

The final mapping from seed to stopping distance is going to be subtle, and probably annoyingly multi-step in some way, or it would have been discovered before now. I have a human hunch there's some kind of correlation with the residue vectors (?), please stay sensitive to patterns in that mapping.
